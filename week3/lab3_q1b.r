# Q1) A computer system uses passwords that are five characters, and each character is one of
# of the 26 letters (a-z) or 10 integers (0-9). The first character has to be a letter. You may
# assume that passwords are not case sensitive.

# (b) the proportion of passwords that begin with a consonant;
# Hint: You will need to divide by your answer from (a). The number will be between 0 and 1.
# answer from (a) = 43670016

# Ctrl + Enter to run (Press on each line of code)
21/26 # = 0.8076923

# OR

21*36*36*36*36 # = 35271936

35271936/43670016 # = 0.8076923
