# Q1) A computer system uses passwords that are five characters, and each character is one of
# of the 26 letters (a-z) or 10 integers (0-9). The first character has to be a letter. You may
# assume that passwords are not case sensitive.

# (c) the proportion of passwords that end with an even number (0,2,4,6,8);

# Ctrl + Enter to run (Press on each line of code)
5/36 # = 0.1388889

# OR

36*36*36*36*36 # = 60466176
36*36*36*36*5  # = 8398080

8398080/60466176 # = 0.1388889
